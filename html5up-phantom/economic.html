							<p>COVID-19 has affected people in many ways, but the pandemic has affected lots of American citizens in a way that is not talked about enough. Millions of people have lost their jobs due to this country’s economic status. One month before the pandemic in the United States (February, 2020), there was 6.2 million unemployed Americans. This number is one of the lowest recorded in the post-World War II era. After just a few months of COVID-19 being in the country, the unemployment rates skyrocketed. The number of Americans without a job increased by more than 14 million by May 2020. 20.5 million citizens of The United States were without a job. This jump is even greater than it was in the Great Recession. From December 2007 (start of recession) to January 2010 (end of recession), the number of unemployed Americans increased by 8.8 million. This means that in three months, the unemployment rate rose more than it did in the three years of the Great Recession. In May 2020, 13% were unemployed, and in January 2010 10.6% were unemployed. This year’s number is significantly larger than that of 2010. While many people are unemployed, some communities are suffering more.</p>
							<p>Surveys have shown that the unemployment rate for women is greater than the rate for men during the coronavirus pandemic. In May 2020, 14.3% of women were unemployed while 11.9% of men were unemployed. If these numbers are investigated further, it reveals that people of color are affected even more. While 11.9% of white women were unemployed in May 2020, 17.2% of black women, 16.7% of Asian women, and 19.5% of Hispanic women were unemployed. Throughout the pandemic, news of this and other coronavirus related information has been spreading through social media.</p>
