							<p>Scientists around the world have been racing to get an effective vaccine to the public. On December 14, 2020, the first non-trial COVID-19 vaccine was administered to an ICU nurse in New York. A few weeks later, vice president-elect Kamala Harris received her first dose of the vaccine. In an interview, she said “I want to encourage everyone to get the vaccine. It is relative painless. It happens really quickly. It is safe…” (Dixon, 2020). The public is being encouraged to get vaccinate, but when will that be possible? Who gets the vaccine first? The CDC has provided recommendations to the government about how the vaccine should be distributed. The CDC made their decision based on the goals they had. They wanted to decrease death as much as possible, while also reducing the extra burden COVID-19 is putting on people. Based on these goals, the CDC recommended that healthcare professionals and residents of long-term care facilities should be offered the first wave of vaccines. The next wave will go to essential front-line works and anyone over the age of 75. The final group that has been determined is people from age 65-74, people from age 16-64 with underlying medical conditions, and all essential workers. The CDC says that as the vaccine is produced and becomes more available, these groups will expand until the entire population has access.</p>
