							<p>The coronavirus pandemic is often compared to the 1918 influenza epidemic. The two diseases are not drastically different, so why not compare them? In 1918, there was about 675,000 deaths from the flu in the United States. In 2020, there was about 330,000 deaths in the United States.  Jerry Hogan has spent this year studying the similarities of the Coronavirus pandemic and the 1918 flu epidemic. He said, “I don’t think that’s a very successful rate in my opinion based on the advancement of technology.” Hogan is saying that in just over a century, we should have made more progress than we did. The death toll is about 48.9% less. If the death toll is such a large difference, then why are the two compared? </p>
							<p>The reason that the coronavirus pandemic is not compared to the 14th century Black Plague is not only because it was much longer ago. The influenza epidemic was much deadlier than the Black Plague, and is still causing some issues to this day. COVID-19 has become extremely dangerous, which is why it is compared to one of the deadliest pandemics. However, the seasonal flu that we have around today is much less lethal than COVID-19.  Historians and scientists are working together to research how the pandemic in 1918 came to an end, and if those methods will work today. Life returned to normal by the early 1920s. Scientists say that people who had been infected with the flu developed a greater immunity to the virus. The flu became less deadly as the pandemic continued in waves. However, the flu is still infecting people today. The virus mutated while passing from mammal to mammal throughout the years. The flu virus ended up mutating into the seasonal flu that we fight today. It is currently unclear whether the coronavirus will act as the flu has, but it is known that the longer the influenza virus existed, the less lethal it was. Scientists worldwide are working together to create an affective vaccine and affective treatments for the COVID-19 disease.</p>
