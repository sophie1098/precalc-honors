                            <p>The graph shown above represents the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases since January 1, 2020. The rate of change is increasing. As the days go on, more cases are introduced than the day before. From day 350 to day 357, about 1,666,736 new cases were introduced. From day 98 to day 105, an estimate of 190,501 new cases were introduced. To compare the number of cases from April to December, you can find the percent rate of change for April and December using the formula: (final amount-initial amount)/(initial amount)Ã—100. This will show the percent that each interval is increasing or decreasing at. The percent rate of change for December is a 44.5327% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The percent rate of change for April is a 515.1839% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. The rate for April is significantly larger than the rate for December. There are many reasons as to why the increase in April was much larger than that of December. Scientists have said that one reason for the large increase is weather. April is when the weather starts to get warmer, and many people want to go outside. People are having more gatherings in the warm months like April, March, and May than in cold months like November, December, and January. Another reason could be that the pandemic was just starting to get serious in April, 2020. People were not used to the restrictions and guideline, so they were more irresponsible.</p>
